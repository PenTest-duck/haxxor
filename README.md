TODO:
- Connect to HTB
- Basic tool calling agent
- Connect to TryHackMe
- Create tools 
- Better SSH/FTP/Telnet connections - keep shell open through tool?
- Store tool output as files?
- Make tool calls async
- Allow human in the loop
- Create sub-agents (e.g. enumeration sub-agent, researcher sub-agent)
- Have multiple generations of agents such that when an agent surrenders, it leaves a note and artifacts (/tmp) for the next lifecycle of the agent
